    <div id=introduction>Technology and Perceived Authenticity of Live Performance</div>
    <div id="byline">Anton Van De Motter</div>

      <p> As technology advances, the music industry has taken full advantage of its benefits. From changes in recording equipment to production software, music has developed in new ways. While the changes in technology in regards to recording and production are generally accepted, the relationship with live performance is far more complex. Critics often question the authenticity of live performances that include elements such as pitch correction, and the emergence of virtual groups such as Gorillaz and K/DA.
      </p>

    <div id=autotune><img src="sound2.png" width="200px" background="transparent">Auto-Tune<img src="sound2.png" width="200px" background="transparent"></div>

      <p> Auto-Tune is a software created by Antares Audio Technology in 1997. The technology eased the process of pitch correction, which was possible but tedious previously. Now, pitch correction is possible even in live performance. Its use has seen mixed reactions. If used to cover up poor vocals, it is frowned upon, but it is praised as an effect for those with strong vocal abilities.
      </p>

      <p> In Rebecca Black's "Friday," a notorious music video released in 2011, the obvious use of Auto-Tune paired with simplistic lyrics and amateur production earned it a reputation as the worst music video ever made. </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, rappers such as Travis Scott often use pitch correction as an effect in live performance.</p>

  <div id=gorillaz>Gorillaz</div>

  <p class="gorl"> Gorillaz is a British virtual band founded in 1998 by Damon Albarn and designed by Jamie Hewlett. The group currently consists of characters 2D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs. Past members include Del the Ghost Rapper, Paula Cracker, Cyborg Noodle, and Ace. The band performs in a variety of ways, but its innovative use of holograms at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon marked a significant point in the history of live performance. Gorrilaz is an early example of the acceptance of technology on stage. Using screens set up in front of a live band, they created an illusion by projecting animated images of the "members" performing. The music and artists were accepted as authentic as they were still performing live but accompanied by images.

  <div id=vocaloid>Vocaloid</div>
  <p> Another example of holograms in live performance is the Vocaloid phenomenon. Unlike Gorrilaz, however, the technlogy in these performances doesn't stop at the visual aspect. Developed by Crypton Future Media, Vocaloid is a software used to create music with a virtual "singer." These voices are paired with an anime style image to create a character. These singers allow music makers to have someone perform their songs without hiring a real person. Anyone with the software can create music with the characters voice. These characters even have "live" tours around the world which attract thousands of fans. By projecting a pre-animated chracter onto a screen, the chracters sing and dance along with a band on stage. Critics might say these performances are not as authentic due to the artificial nature of main performers.

  <div id=league>League of Legends</div>
  <p class="league"> Riot Games, an American video game developer and creator of the multiplayer online game League of Legends, is also known for its theatrical e-sports tournaments. The team is innovative in its use of hologram and AR technology in live performances. Even with elements of the shows being pre-made, fans still pack the arenas and accept the hybrid artform.

<p class="league2">Hologram</p>
<p class="league2"> Riot Games revealed "holo projection" technology in the opening ceremony of the 2019 League of Legends World Championship final in Paris. Using a 3DHolonet, which incorporates silver into the fabric of a mesh scrim, Riot Games brought League of Legends characters to the stage in real time alongside the singers who voice them. The performance featured virtual hip-hop group True Damage, composed of characters Ekko, Akali, Qiyanna, Senna, and Yasuo. They are voiced by human artists Becky G, Keke Palmer, Duckwrth, Thutmose, and Soyeon.
</p>

<p>Augmented Reality</p>
<p> Riot Games first brought their legendary virtual pop group, K/DA, to the stage during the 2018 League of Legends World Championship in Incheon, Korea. The group is voiced by American singers Madison Beer and Jaira Burns, and two members of the K-pop girl group (G)I-dle, Miyeon and Soyeon. Using augmented reality, Riot Games brought the characters Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai'Sa on stage to perform their debut song "POP/STARS" with their human singers. The group came back for the 2020 League of Legends World Championship in Shanghai, where they performed "More" and included guest singer Seraphine, voiced by Lexie Liu during the show.

  <div id=conclusion>Future of Live Performance</div>

  <p> As technology makes its way towards more advanced reality simulations and artificial intellegence, people might wonder how it will shape the music industry. Projects such as the collaboration between Cypton Future Media's Vocaloid software and the HRP-4C robot give us a glimpse of what that future might be like. Would fans still be as enthusiastic about attending these "live" performances? Based on the commitment of fans flocking to see animated projections, they may even be more likely to see their favorite characters come to life as a singing, dancing robot.
